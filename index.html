      <div class="introduction">
        <p>Hello, <br>
        If you're looking to find the best tacos in the city, you've come to the right place!</p>
        <p>When I first moved to Chicago, everyone told me I had to find the best pizza and burgers in the city. However, although this girl loves <a href="http://www.pizanoschicago.com/">pizza</a> and <a href="http://auchevalchicago.com/">burgers</a>  (I did link my favorite places for both), I had my sites set on something bigger...tacos. But not just any tacos, fish tacos. I was determined to find the best fish tacos in Chicago... more like Chitaco. Amirite?? (Ok, last attempt at a pun).</p>
       <p>So now that you're here and you know what you can find here, let's taco 'bout it. (Alright, I lied, so many more puns ahead)</p>
        <p>First and foremost, I can't just tell you the best taco joints in the city. That's too vague. Therefore, in true Chicago fashion, I'm going to break in down into neighborhoods. I've narrowed it down to my top choice per neighborhood. I've chosen the six neighborhoods I frequent the most, but there are about a ma'million I could have chosen from.</p>
        <p>I'm going taco 'bout my favorite gems for fish tacos (and more!) in the following neighborhoods:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Wicker Park</li>
          <li>Lakeview</li>
          <li>River North</li>
          <li>Gold Coast</li>
          <li>The Loop</li>
          <li>Old Town</li>
        </ul>
        <div id="form">
          <p>But before we really get started, do YOU have an reccos for tacos; both of the fish variety and just regular kind?</p>
          <p>If so, head on over to the link below and lettuce:</p>

        <p class="recco">Recommendation:</p><p>Can I recommend everything? It's my favorite taco place in all the land (Specifically the land of Chitaco, er, I mean Chicago)</p>
        <p>I don't typically like fried fish tacos, but their fish tacos (see pic below!) are so dang good that I make an exception... around four exceptions as that's how many I usually eat.</p>

        <p>Peruse their <a href="http://www.antiquetaco.com/menu/">menu</a> and if you'd rather not take my word for it, check out their ratings on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Antique-Taco-158817610862018/">Facebook,</a> the people of Chitaco (it's going to catch on) love Antique Taco!</p>

        <p>(Additional locations: River North & Wicker Park)</p>
        <p class="recco">Recommendation:</p> <p>I'll be honest, I have yet to experience Big & Little's and for someone who is on the search for the best fish tacos in Chicago, I am little disappointed in myself, because their fish taco selection is off da hook! They have TEN different options.</p>
        <p>If you don't believe me, go check out their <a href=" https://www.bigandlittleschicago.com/menus">menu</a> and while you're at it, like 'em on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/bignlittles">Facebook</a></p>

        </div>
       <p class="recco">Recommendation:</p> <p>They USED to have the best grilled salmon taco in the city (pictured below, taken by yours truly) Finding a salmon taco is honestly harder than you think, so I'm crushed to not see it on their current <a href="http://bucket.tallboytaco.com/wp-content/uploads/tallboymenu.pdf?date=07-09-2017">menu</a>. However, their shrimp taco and beer-battered talapia is a close second.</p>

        <p> P.S Don't forget to order a pitcher of their Sangria and when they say their guacamole is spicy... they mean it!</p>

          </nav>
        </div>
        <p class="recco">Recommendation:</p> <p>Yes, of course, I love all their fish tacos (especially #17 Ahi Poke), but honestly, this is definitely my favorite taco joint for beef; Their slow roasted angus brisket is pretty dope (#12). Here are my other top contenders:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>#11 Grilled flank steak</li>
          <li>#2 Rotisserie Chicken</li>
          <li>#7 Cuban Pig</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Do yourself a favor, and not only check out their tasty <a href="https://velvettaco.com/menu/">menu</a>, but also their sweet, interactive menu!</p>
        <p>My favorite part? The way the images adjust on the right to match the menus on the left. If you scroll down far enough on the source page, you'll see where this is being done. I don't understand it how, but I see things like "#menu-chick .left" and "menu-check .right" with some of these { } and a url for the image. Here's something interesting. If you look at the code, you see that the "h1" heading tag was used to display the overall menu section, for example "Chick" however, when highlighting each chicken taco under that heading, the "h3" heading tag was used...why was "h2" not used??</p>

        </div>
        <p> (Additional locations: Old Town & Lincoln Park)</p>
        <p class="recco">Recommendation:</p> <p>The tacos are great (Order Camarones; shrimp tacos you'll want to write home about) but honestly, my favorite part about Broken English is their margaritas!</p>
        <p>See if you find something you like on their <a href="https://www.tacopub.com/menu">menu</a> and plan your next Tequila Tuesday here!</p>

        <p class="recco">Recommendation:</p> <p>This is the mecca of all fish taco joints. When I discovered buzz bait, I thought I was seeing things, like a mirage; a place dedicated to just fish tacos?! Can it be true? Yes, yes it can. Buzz Bait focuses on freshly prepared, premium fish tacos.</p>
        <p>And thus, one would think your search is over Michelle, you've found it; the best fish Tacos in Chicago. And to that I say, are we ever really done searching? We are all searching in life. Keep searching for your fish taco; whatever your fish taco might be. Never stop believing. Never give up.</p>
        <p>View their small but mighty menu <a href="http://www.buzzbaitchicago.com/menu/">here</a> and after you've experienced their greatness, show 'em some love on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BuzzBaitChi">Facebook!</a></p>
